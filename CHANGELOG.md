# Changelog

## 0.1.0

Initial Ogg release, rebuilt as a separate Home Assistant integration.

- Offline-friendly setup with connection and address sensors.
- Five fixed server addresses and five sensor-supplied addresses.
- Background discovery, reconnect and failover.
- Master enable, per-device run, timed pulse and grouped controls.
- Software patterns with intensity, cycle period and motor controls.
- Explicitly selected native patterns for supported classic We-Vibe models.
- Original device names, retained settings and redacted diagnostics.
- HACS repository structure, regression tests and validation workflows.

Physical-device acceptance testing is required before treating a release as
hardware-validated. The protocol and Home Assistant tests use simulated servers.
